<p><em>This article is a stub, more info coming soon. Colors in Odin are currently a bit messy and need to be cleaned up</em></p>

<p>To change the colors used in Odin, first navigate to <code class="highlighter-rouge">_scss/_variables.scss</code>.</p>

<p>This file contains all of the colors used in Odin. The primary colors you should be concerned about changing are listed below.</p>

<p><strong>$primary-color</strong> - the main brand color used in Odin. This is used in places such as header background and link colors.</p>

<p><strong>$highlight-color</strong> - primarily used for link hover states.</p>

<p>After editing any colors, run <code class="highlighter-rouge">jekyll serve</code> to see the changes locally. If youâ€™re satisfied with your changes, run <code class="highlighter-rouge">jekyll build</code> and then push your changes to your repo.</p>
