<p><em>This article is a stub, more info coming soon. Some sections should be cleaned up.</em></p>

<p>You can change virtually all of Odinâ€™s content from the <code class="highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code> file. There are three things you cannot change from here, which need to be changed elsewhere - <a href="">colors</a>, <a href="">fonts</a>, and <a href="">categories</a>. Everything else is edited from this file.</p>

<h5 id="base-content">Base Content</h5>

<p>At the top of <code class="highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code> youâ€™ll find a number of base settings you should change. These include your site title and description, as well as your brand logo and name. It also includes options to change the home page header and subheader.</p>

<h5 id="navigation-links">Navigation Links</h5>
<p>Out of the box, Odin supports 3 custom navigation links + a â€˜return homeâ€™ button. Each link supports a name and a link. If you want to disable a link, just add <code class="highlighter-rouge">#</code> to both options for that link.</p>

<p>The navigation button can be edited by changing the <code class="highlighter-rouge">nav_button</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">nav_button_link</code> options.</p>

<h5 id="more-help-section">More Help Section</h5>

<p>The more help section shows up under your list of categories on your homepage, as well as under each article. This section supports 0, 1 or 2 content blocks, which can be edited from the # More Help section of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code> file. These sections are a great way to add links to your email, twitter, or other methods for users to reach you for support.</p>

<p><strong>help_one_title</strong> - the header title for this section</p>

<p><strong>help_one_content</strong> - the extended text for this help section. Works best if under 200 characters.</p>

<p><strong>help_one_button</strong> - the text to show for the link in this help section</p>

<p><strong>help_one_link</strong> - where the help section button should take users</p>

<h5 id="social-links">Social Links</h5>

<p>The social links section defines which social links show in the footer. By default Odin supports Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Email, and Github. Simply add the relevant social item to the right section, or add <code class="highlighter-rouge">#</code> if you donâ€™t want that social item to show in the footer.</p>

<hr />

<p>After making any changes to the above, run <code class="highlighter-rouge">jekyll serve</code> to see the changes locally. If youâ€™re satisfied with your changes, run <code class="highlighter-rouge">jekyll build</code> and then push your changes to your repo.</p>
